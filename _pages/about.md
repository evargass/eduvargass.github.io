I am an Economist from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru and alumnus of the Program on Leadership, Liberal Arts and Public Service of Brown University and the Botin Foundation.

I currently serve as the Policy and Research Manager of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL LAC) in the Dominican Republic. My interests are focused on the evaluation and design of public policies, applied microeconomics, industrial organization, and economics of education.
